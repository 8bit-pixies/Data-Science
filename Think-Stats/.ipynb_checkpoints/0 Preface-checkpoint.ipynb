      "## Why I wrote this book\n",
      "\n",
      "_Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers_ is a textbook for a\n",
      "new kind of introductory prob-stat class. It emphasizes the use of statistics\n",
      "to explore large datasets. It takes a computational approach, which has\n",
      "several advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Students write programs as a way of developing and testing their understanding. For example, they write functions to compute a least squares fit, residuals, and the coefficient of determination. Writing and testing this code requires them to understand the concepts and implicitly corrects misunderstandings.\n",
      "* Students run experiments to test statistical behavior. For example, they explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by generating samples from several distributions. When they see that the sum of values from a Pareto distribution doesn\u2019t converge to normal, they remember the assumptions the CLT is based on.\n",
      "* Some ideas that are hard to grasp mathematically are easy to understand by simulation. For example, we approximate p-values by running Monte Carlo simulations, which reinforces the meaning of the p-value.\n",
      "* Using discrete distributions and computation makes it possible to present topics like Bayesian estimation that are not usually covered in an introductory class. For example, one exercise asks students to compute the posterior distribution for the \u201cGerman tank problem,\u201d which is difficult analytically but surprisingly easy computationally.\n",
      "* Because students work in a general-purpose programming language (Python), they are able to import data from almost any source. They are not limited to data that has been cleaned and formatted for a particular statistics tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book lends itself to a project-based approach. In my class, students work\n",
      "on a semester-long project that requires them to pose a statistical question,\n",
      "find a dataset that can address it, and apply each of the techniques they\n",
      "learn to their own data.\n",
      "\n",
      "To demonstrate the kind of analysis I want students to do, the book presents a\n",
      "case study that runs through all of the chapters. It uses data from two\n",
      "sources:\n",

      "## How I wrote this book\n",
      "\n",
      "When people write a new textbook, they usually start by reading a stack of old\n",
      "textbooks. As a result, most books contain the same material in pretty much\n",
      "the same order. Often there are phrases, and errors, that propagate from one\n",
      "book to the next; Stephen Jay Gould pointed out an example in his essay, \u201cThe\n",
      "Case of the Creeping Fox Terrier1.\u201d(A breed of dog that is about half the size\n",
      "of a [Hyrocotherium](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyracotherium).\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not do that. In fact, I used almost no printed material while I was\n",
      "writing this book, for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "* My goal was to explore a new approach to this material, so I didn\u2019t want much exposure to existing approaches.\n",
      "* Since I am making this book available under a free license, I wanted to make sure that no part of it was encumbered by copyright restrictions.\n",
      "* Many readers of my books don\u2019t have access to libraries of printed material, so I tried to make references to resources that are freely available on the Internet.\n",
      "* Proponents of old media think that the exclusive use of electronic resources is lazy and unreliable. They might be right about the first part, but I think they are wrong about the second, so I wanted to test my theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resource I used more than any other is Wikipedia, the bugbear of\n",
      "librarians everywhere. In general, the articles I read on statistical topics\n",
      "were very good (although I made a few small changes along the way). I include\n",
      "references to Wikipedia pages throughout the book and I encourage you to\n",
      "follow those links; in many cases, the Wikipedia page picks up where my\n",
      "description leaves off. The vocabulary and notation in this book are generally\n",
      "consistent with Wikipedia, unless I had a good reason to deviate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other resources I found useful were Wolfram MathWorld and (of course) Google.\n",
      "I also used two books, David MacKay\u2019s _Information Theory, Inference, and\n",
      "Learning Algorithms_, which is the book that got me hooked on Bayesian\n",
