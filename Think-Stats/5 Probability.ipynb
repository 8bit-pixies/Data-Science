      "The \u201cthings\u201d we assign probabilities to are called **events**. If _E_\n",
      "represents an event, then _P_(_E_) represents the probability that _E_\u00a0will\n",

      "$$P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) P(B)$$ \n",
      "\n",
      "_Warning: not always true!_\n",
      "\n",
      "where \\\\(P(A \\text{ and } B)\\\\) is the probability that events \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) both occur. This formula is easy to remember; the only problem is that it is not always true. This formula only applies if \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are independent, which means that if I know \\\\(A\\\\) occurred, that doesn\u2019t change the probability of \\\\(B\\\\), and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if \\\\(A\\\\) is tossing a coin and getting heads, and \\\\(B\\\\) is rolling a die and getting 1, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are independent, because the coin toss doesn\u2019t tell me anything about the die roll.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I roll two dice, and \\\\(A\\\\) is getting at least one six, and \\\\(B\\\\) is getting two sixes, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are not independent, because if I know that \\\\(A\\\\) occurred, the probability of \\\\(B\\\\) is higher, and if I know \\\\(B\\\\) occurred, the probability of \\\\(A\\\\) is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "When \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are not independent, it is often useful to compute the conditional probability, \\\\(P(A|B)\\\\), which is the probability of \\\\(A\\\\) given that we know \\\\(B\\\\) occurred:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "From that we can derive the general relation\n",
      "\n",
      "$$P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) P(B|A)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "This might not be as easy to remember, but if you translate it into English it should make sense: \u201cThe chance of both things happening is the chance that the first one happens, and then the second one given the first.\u201d\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing special about the order of events, so we could also write\n",
      "\n",
      "$$P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(B) P(A|B)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships hold whether \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are independent or not. If they are independent, then \\\\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\\\), which gets us back where we started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because all probabilities are in the range 0 to 1, it is easy to show that\n",
      "\n",
      "$$P(A \\text{ and } B) \\leq P(A)$$\n",

It seems obvious that the club will get smaller, or stay the same if it happens that all the members satisfy \\\\(B\\\\).
