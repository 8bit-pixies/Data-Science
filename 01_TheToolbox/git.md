# Git

Git is a tool for version control. It is a popular system used in websites like Github
or Bitbucket. Love it or hate it, git will be a part of your everyday life as a developer.
This chapter will give you an idea of some of the features, but the best way is to learn by
being forced; normally the hard way.

## Points to Ponder

*  What is Git?
*  Why is Git useful for a developer? A team of developers?
*  How do you see history of all your commits?
*  What is a "merge"? "pull request"? "forking"? "cloning"?
