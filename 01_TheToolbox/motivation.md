## Why Python?

There are currently some introductions to data science using Python:

*  [Udacity's Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud359)
*  [University of Washington (Coursera) Introductin to Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci) (Also uses R and SQL)

Indeed, both of these free courses are an amazing introduction to Python.
This aims to hopefully supplement this knowledge, through learning
materials by projects.
